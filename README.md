Matlab code to reproduce the numerical experiments of the paper "A mass-lumped finite element discretization for the  Gross-Pitaevskii ground state: uniqueness, positivity, and global convergence" by M. Hauck, Y. Liang, D. Peterseim. If you use this code, please cite the paper.
The code builds upon a basic implementation of the P1 finite element method on simplicial meshes previously used for the book "Numerical homogenization by localized orthogonal decomposition" by A. MÃ¥lqvist and D. Peterseim (SIAM Spotlights 5, ISBN: 978-1-611976-44-1, 2020). The implementation of the solver for the nonlinear eigenvalue problem is adapted from the publications [Henning/Peterseim SIAM J. NUMER. ANAL. 58(3):1744-1772, 2020] and [Altmann/Peterseim/Stykel M2AN 56:1629-1653, 2022].
